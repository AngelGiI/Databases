**Databases Course - SQL and Implementation**

This repository contains materials and exercises from my Databases course, covering a wide range of topics in database design, querying, and implementation. The focus was on understanding and applying key database concepts using SQL and MySQL.

### Topics Covered:
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):**  
  Creating and managing database schemas, tables, constraints, and relationships.
  
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**  
  Inserting, updating, and deleting data within relational databases.

- **DML SELECT Queries:**  
  Crafting complex queries to retrieve and manipulate data, including joins, subqueries, and aggregations.

- **Triggers and Stored Procedures:**  
  Writing and implementing triggers, functions, and procedures to automate processes and enforce business logic.

- **Database Implementation:**  
  Exploring advanced database features, including:
  - Storage engines.
  - Character sets and collation.
  - Geospatial data types.
  - Database optimization and performance tuning.

This repository demonstrates practical knowledge of SQL and database management, along with hands-on experimentation using MySQL tools and techniques.
